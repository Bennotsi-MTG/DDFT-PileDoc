# Conjurer's Bauble piles

At the time of writing (July 2017) this is still a relatively new card 
to play around with. Histroically Sensei's Divining Top held a place as
a standard 4-of in the deck to act as deck filtering and a 'free saved'
card draw for Doomsday piles. More information on how this was used can 
be found in the Doomsday Library: LINK PLACEHOLDER   

Conjurer's Bauble was identified as the closest equivalent for use in 
Doomsday storm or Laboratory Maniac piles that would allow a free draw
that was also resistant to having to discard as a result of using Lion's
Eye Diamonds. In can be included as a singleton copy to act as a copy 
element however it has some interesting properties when multiples are 
available in a deck.    

## Using a single CB in a pile

Let's simply start off by looking at the basic function of Conjurer's 
Bauble as simply a tool to draw cards when using LED.   
A standard pile is below:   

```
-> IU, CB, GP, LED, LM.                  BBB+UU1 (6)      

```

As can be observed, it is much more effective to use CB when using IU as
opposed to either TW or AoI (Both of which can allow the use of LED without
needing to discard). This is not however the true strength of CB.
